# Household Energy Consumption Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to tackle the critical issue of energy management by developing a machine learning model capable of predicting household energy consumption. By analyzing historical energy usage data, this model will enable both consumers and energy providers to forecast future energy needs more effectively, thereby optimizing resource allocation and reducing costs.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to provide a predictive model that offers actionable insights into energy usage trends. This will not only help households manage their energy consumption more efficiently but also assist energy providers in planning and forecasting demand.
